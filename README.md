# Gif2MoireGifCLI
I was bored and suddenly I remembered about these notebooks that were sold in my school before with stripey images and when you moved a vertiacl grid? across the image it made an animation. I understood how that works and made this. Then someone recommended to make a CLI tool out of this. So here we are.
The best gifs to use as input ones are small resolution gifs with 2 - 5 frames. You can see what happens with gifs with many frames when you run the tool on a sample gif with the cube. And big resolution gifs have big loading times and the resulting gif would be enormous in size(memory) and be unsendable because of size
